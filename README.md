# GetHandsDirty


This is a collection of all my code works on learning and practising technics.


On the conceptual of always make hands dirty, rather than just reading books, documents and videos.


Currently there are three part:


* **HandsonAlgorithms**


    Here records my works on LeetCode and reimplement algorithms from the *Introduction of Algorithms*


* **HandsonPytorch**


    Here records my practising code on pytorch and some popupar neural networks
    

* **HandsonCpp**

    Here is my practising and demo code when trying to improve cpp programming ability.


For the further, I'm also planning to do some practising on TensorFlow, and some web development for fun.
